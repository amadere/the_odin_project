Basic Ruby on Rails data types:

Numbers
Ruby has typical math operators. 

1 + 1 
2 - 1
2 * 2
10 / 5
2 ** 2 (exponent)
8 % 2 (modulus, or finding the remainder of division)

Integers and Floats
Integers are whole numbers. Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point. 
When doing arithmetic with integers, the result will always be an integer.

17 / 5 = 3 (not 3.4)
17 / 5.0 = 3.4

Converting number types:
13.to_f = 13.0
13.9.to_i = 13

Number Methods:
6.even? = true
7.even? = false
6.odd? = false
7.odd? = true

Strings 
Strings can be formed with " " or ' ' quotations (string literals)

Concatenation
Plus operator:  "Welcome " + "to " + "Odin!" = "Welcome to Odin!"
Shovel operator: "Welcome " << "to " << "Odin!" = "Welcome to Odin!"
Concat method: "Welcome ".concat("to ").concat("Odin!")
